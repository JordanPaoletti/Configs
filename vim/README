The purpose of this set up is to separate the vimrc
into different components for easier maintanance.

Each file contains cpp directives in order to allow
different versions of the vimrc to be created
(eg. ideavimrc, with or without plugins)

doc will contain all the includes, so the file can
be created by running

cpp -P -w -ansi -traditional-cpp doc out.vim
